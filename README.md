# SeeCraft

SeeCraft is an image classification algorithm that detects the presence of ships in satellite imagery.   
This repository contains a folder of test images which you may use, but feel free to use images of your own.    
   
You can access the SeeCraft application here: https://share.streamlit.io/bfterrizzi/seecraft/main.
   
Have fun testing different images and let me know if you get some surprising results!   
   
NOTE: If the application fails to load (usually indicated by am "OH NO!" message), this is most likely due to monthly bandwidth constraints in Git's large file storage (due to Seecraft's model size). I intend to upgrade this bandwidth contsraints in the future.
