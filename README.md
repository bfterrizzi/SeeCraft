# Seecraft

Seecraft is an image classification algorithm that detects the presence of ships in satellite imagery.
This repository contains a folder of test images which give the user a sense of some the algorithm's limitations. 
Have fun testing these (or other images) and let me know if you get some surprising results or have questions or comments.
