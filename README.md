# Seecraft

Seecraft is an image classification algorithm that detects the presence of ships in satellite imagery.
This repository contains a folder of test images which give the user a sense of some the algorithm's limitations. 

You may link to the application here: https://share.streamlit.io/bfterrizzi/seecraft/main

Have fun testing these and other images and let me know if you get some surprising results!
